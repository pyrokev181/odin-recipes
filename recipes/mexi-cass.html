    <h2>Description:</h2>
    <p>Mexican cuisine can range from extremely simple to very complex, and all of it is incredibly tasty. This simple recipe uses just 5 ingredients to bring the world's favorite cuisine right to your kitchen!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 (16 ounce) can refried beans</li>
            <li>3/4 onion, diced</li>
            <li>5 (10 inch) flour torillas</li>
            <li>1 cup salsa</li>
            <li>2 cups shredded Cheddar or Colby Jack cheese</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Steps:</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to <strong>375 degrees F (190 degrees C).</strong> Spray a 9-inch pie pan with non-stick cooking spray.</li>
            <li>In a saucepan, cook refried beans and onions (to soften them) on <strong>medium-high heat for about 5 minutes.</strong></li>
            <li>Place one tortilla in the bottom of the greased pan. Spread about <strong>1/3 cup</strong> of the bean mixture over it. Layer a few tablespoons of salsa over this. Then, place another tortilla over the salsa, and add more of the bean mixture. Follow the beans with a big handful of cheese, spreading evenly.</li>
            <li>Repeat layers, spreading the ingredients evenly over the tortillas. On the top layer, make sure to use lots of salsa and cheese!</li>
            <li>Bake until the cheese is melted, approximately <strong>15 to 20 minutes.</strong></li>
        </ol>
    <h3>Optional Tips:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Brown <strong>1 pound</strong> ground beef and add to the bean mixture to make this dish one with meat. Be sure to season the meat with cumin and chili powder for that Mexican cuisine kick!</li>
            <li>Add <strong>1 cup</strong> salsa verde (green salsa) to the ingredients list, and alternate the red and green salsa when building the layers.</li>
            <li>When the casserole is done, spread some sour cream or guacamole for a cool contrast to the hot food!</li>
        </ul>
